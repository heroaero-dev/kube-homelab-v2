📦 kube-homelab-v2
A fully refactored, production-grade, GitOps-driven Kubernetes homelab.

This repository contains the second-generation architecture of my Kubernetes homelab.
After several months of hands-on learning and experimenting with FluxCD, Helm, Kustomize, and GitOps patterns, I decided to rebuild the structure from the ground up to follow a cleaner, more modular, and industry-standard layout.

The goal of this repo is to provide a stable foundation for:

- declarative GitOps deployments

- Kubernetes best practices

- clean separation of apps, infrastructure, and platform services

- easier debugging and upgrades

- long-term maintainability
