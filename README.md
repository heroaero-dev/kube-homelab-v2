# 🛠️ Homelab DevOps Progress Tracker

This repository tracks my journey in learning and applying **DevOps engineering** practices through hands-on homelab projects.

## 🧠 Background

I started with **Docker Swarm**, but after running into its limitations, I transitioned to using **Kubernetes** — specifically a **3-node K3s cluster** with one manager node. This move helped me understand container orchestration at a deeper level.

## 🚀 Current Goals

- Deploy and manage my own containers and pods using **official documentation** only
- Avoid using tutorials to build self-reliance and deepen understanding
- Maintain all stack configurations, manifests, and infra as code in this repository

## 📦 Current Setup

- **K3s**: Lightweight Kubernetes for managing multi-node infrastructure
- **Thinkpad E14**: My mobile workstation for testing, live debugging, and on-the-go infrastructure adjustments.
- **Tailscale + Cloudflare Tunnel**: For secure remote access

## 🧾 Notes

Everything here reflects real mistakes, learning, and iteration — this repo isn't polished for show, it's built for growth. 💪

## 🛠️ GitOps Pipeline

This repo is fully managed via **FluxCD**, using a pull-driven GitOps model.  
Every change merged into `main` is automatically deployed to the cluster.

### Components included:

- **FluxCD** (GitOps engine)  
- **Helm** (package and lifecycle management)  
- **Kustomize** (declarative configuration layering)  
- **External Secrets Operator** (secure secrets sync from external stores)  
- **KEDA** (event-driven autoscaling)  
- **Longhorn** (distributed block storage)  
- **Cloudflared Tunnel** (secure remote ingress)  
- **Prometheus + Grafana** (monitoring + dashboards)
